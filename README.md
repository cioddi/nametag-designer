## Status

This is older code that was previously hosted elsewhere, but due to rising hosting costs, it has been moved to GitHub Pages for free hosting. The code may not be actively maintained, but it remains functional for designing nameplates.

# Nametag Designer

This is a web-based tool for creating custom 3D printed nameplates. It's designed to make it easy to outfit your shop equipment with personalized name tags, replacing the traditional brass plates with modern 3D printed versions.

## Features

- Choose from a wide variety of fonts, ranging from delicate scripts to military-style stencils
- Select different border shapes
- Adjust parameters like padding and base thickness
- Real-time 3D preview powered by modern web technologies
- Export to STL format for 3D printing

## How to Use

1. Select your preferred font and border shape
2. Enter your text
3. Fine-tune the settings (padding, thickness, etc.)
4. Preview the 3D model in real-time
5. Download the STL file and print it

**Note:** The exported STL may not indicate the actual size clearly. You might need to scale it down in your slicer software, as initial exports could be quite large (e.g., 300 mm long).

## Background

This tool was originally developed to simplify the process of creating nameplates using CAD software. With a large collection of fonts, it handles the complexities of importing and extruding text into 3D shapes, making it accessible for beginners.

It's reminiscent of other web-based 3D design tools, such as those for generating QR codes in plastic.
